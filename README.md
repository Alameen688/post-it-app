# PostIt
PostIt is a simple application that allows friends and colleagues create groups for notifications. This way one person can post notifications to everyone by sending a message once. The application allows people create accounts, create groups and add registered users to the groups, and then send messages out to these groups whenever they want.

## Getting Started
Presently, because this app is still in development, you can only test its features using PostMan, and nodemon to run on console.

## Features
API routes for users to create accounts and login to the application:
POST: /user/signup Username, Password & Email Address

POST: /group/<group id>/user
